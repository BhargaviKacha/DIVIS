<p>"How's the vis?", is perhaps THE question among leisure divers. Observing any popular dive site in the cold waters of the Puget Sound, WA USA, for example, would reveal interest in water visibility to be near universal. It is the first question asked by any diver arriving on site to their colleagues emerging from the water.</p>

<p>Our objective is to create an affordable, reliable and accurate system capable of predicting same day and forecasted (24hrs +) water visibility.</p>

<p>Currently this repository only contains code for the DIVIS app which interprets data from the DIVIS light collection unit, but eventually we will update the repository with the already developed 3D image files for printed parts for the custom cell case and designs and instructions to construct the light collection unit.</p>

<p>The DIVIS sensor as currently designed can be printed and assembled as a DIY project with minimal skill requirements. </p>

<p>More about the goals of this project.</p>

<p>SPECIFIC SUCCESS CRITERIA</p>

<ul>
<li>&lt; $100 to build and deploy</li>
<li>&lt; $100 / yr to operate/maintain</li>
<li>&gt; 6 months in water with no maintenance</li>
<li>&lt; 3 feet (1 meter) margin of error thoughout a deployment</li>
</ul>

<p>ABOUT THE NAME</p>

<p>DIVIS is simply a combination of DIV-er and VIS-ibility. It is pronounced die-viss; a soft "s" sound not a "z".</p>
