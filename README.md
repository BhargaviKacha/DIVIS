# DIVIS

"How's the vis?", is perhaps THE question among leisure divers. Observing any popular dive site in the cold waters of the Puget Sound, WA USA, for example, would reveal interest in water visibility to be near universal. It is the first question asked by any diver arriving on site to their colleagues emerging from the water.
 
Our objective is to create an affordable, reliable and accurate system capable of predicting same day and forecasted water visibility.

The DIVIS sensor as currently designed can be printed and assembled as a DIY project with minimal skill requirements. 

DIY ready hardward plans + app are currently under development. Check back soon. 



SPECIFIC SUCCESS CRITERIA
* < $100 to build and deploy
* < $100 / yr to operate/maintain
* > 6 months in water with no maintenance
* < 3 feet (1 meter) margin of error thoughout a deployment
 


ABOUT THE NAME

DIVIS is simply a combination of DIV-er and VIS-ibility. It is pronounced die-viss; a soft "s" sound not a "z".
